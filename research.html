        <h2>Numerical Simulation of Hypersonic Flows</h2>
        <p>
            Hypersonic flows, characterized by their extreme speeds and complex physical phenomena, are a critical area in aerospace engineering. 
            My research focuses on the development and application of advanced numerical methods to model shock waves, boundary layer interactions, 
            and thermal effects in hypersonic regimes. By leveraging computational fluid dynamics (CFD), I aim to provide deeper insights into 
            vehicle performance, thermal protection systems, and aerodynamic design in these challenging environments.

        <h2>Computational Acoustics</h2>
        <p>
            Noise prediction and control are essential for the next generation of aircraft and aerospace systems. My work in computational acoustics 
            explores the use of numerical simulations to study the generation, propagation, and mitigation of noise in complex systems. This includes 
            analyzing jet noise, turbulence-generated sound, and sound propagation in non-uniform media. The goal is to enable quieter and more efficient 
            designs, contributing to a more sustainable aviation industry.

        <h2>Data Analysis and Advanced Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            The growing availability of high-fidelity data in aerospace engineering has opened new opportunities for analysis and optimization. 
            My research employs advanced techniques such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and machine learning to extract meaningful patterns 
            and insights from complex datasets. These methods are applied to a variety of challenges, including flow stability analysis, anomaly detection, 
            and performance optimization in aerodynamic systems. By integrating data-driven approaches, I aim to enhance understanding and innovation 
            in the aerospace sector.
