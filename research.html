        <h2>Numerical Simulation of Hypersonic Flows</h2>
        <p> Hypersonic flows, characterized by their extreme speeds and complex physical phenomena, are increasingly 
            important in aerospace engineering. This is due to both the space race and the increased interest in hypersonic flight vehicles as scramjets.</p>

        <p> My research applies advanced numerical methods to model shock waves, Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions  (SWBLI), 
            and thermal effects in hypersonic regimes. </p>

        <p> I use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to provide deeper insights into vehicle performance, thermal protection systems, 
            and aerodynamic design in these challenging environments. </p>

    <article id="computational-acoustics">
        <h2>Computational Acoustics</h2>
<p> Noise prediction and control are essential for the next generation of aircraft and aerospace systems. </p>

<p> My work in computational acoustics explores using numerical simulations to study noise generation, propagation, 
    and mitigation in aerodynamic devices. This includes analyzing jet noise, turbulence-generated sound, and sound propagation 
    in non-uniform media. The goal is to enable quieter and more efficient designs, contributing to a more sustainable aviation industry. </p>

<p> The numerical techniques involved in this research involve using high-order numerical simulation codes together 
    with the linearised version of the Navier-Stokes equations. Except for the treatment of reactive mixtures, 
    these codes are the same as those used in the study of hypersonic flows. Therefore, the tools used are essentially 
    the same as in the previous case. </p>

    <article id="data-analysis">
        <h2>Data Analysis and Advanced Techniques</h2>
<p> The growing availability of high-fidelity data in aerospace engineering has opened new opportunities for analysis and optimization. </p>
<p> My research employs advanced techniques such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and machine learning to extract meaningful patterns and 
    insights from complex datasets. These methods are applied to various challenges, including flow stability analysis and optimization in dynamic systems. </p>
<p> By integrating data-driven approaches, I aim to enhance understanding and innovation in the aerospace sector, especially in its application 
    to hypersonic flows and acoustics problems. </p>
